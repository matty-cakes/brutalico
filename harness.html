          Brutalist architecture is an architectural style that emerged during
          the 1950s in the United Kingdom, among the reconstruction projects of
          the post-war era but commonly known for its presence in post-war
          communist nations.[1][2][3][4][5] Brutalist buildings are
          characterised by minimalist constructions that showcase the bare
          building materials and structural elements over decorative
          design.[6][7] The style commonly makes use of exposed, unpainted
          concrete or brick, angular geometric shapes and a predominantly
          monochrome colour palette;[8][7] other materials, such as steel,
          timber, and glass, are also featured.[9]
